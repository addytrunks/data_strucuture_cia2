# Data Structures

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Structures repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures commonly used in computer science and programming.

## KD Tree

A KD Tree, short for K-Dimensional Tree, is a data structure used for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. It is a binary tree structure where each node represents a k-dimensional point. KD Trees are particularly useful for efficient nearest neighbor search and range search operations in multi-dimensional spaces.

For more information and detailed usage of the KD Tree implementation in this repository, navigate to the [KD Tree folder](./KD-TREE/README.md).

## B Tree

A B Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. B Trees are commonly used in database systems and file systems.

For more information and detailed usage of the B Tree implementation in this repository, navigate to the [B Tree folder](./B-TREE/README.md).

## College Project

This project is part of my college coursework in artificial intelligence and data science at SNU Chennai.
